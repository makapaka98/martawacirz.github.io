Florianopolis, known as Floripa by the locals, is situated in the southern part of Brazil on the island of Santa Catarina. It has emerged as an excellent destination for digital nomads. For those who need to adhere to a specific time zone due to work, Floripa is only 4 hours behind most European time zones and just 1 hour behind EST, making it a convenient choice for individuals working with teams based in the US and Europe.

My main concern when traveling to Brazil was safety, particularly as a solo female traveler. However, this is not something you need to worry about in Floripa. Throughout my entire stay, I felt extremely safe and did not encounter any unpleasant situations. Nevertheless, it's always important to exercise common sense, as experiences may vary from person to person. Floripa offers an ideal combination of beach and city life. If you enjoy outdoor activities like running, hiking, playing beach volleyball, or surfing—just like me—you're bound to fall in love with Floripa, as it has it all and more. Most digital nomads tend to stay in the neighborhoods of Lagoa (which does not have beach access but is situated between two lakes, perfect for kitesurfers), Campeche (a beachfront neighborhood), or Rio Tavares (right next to Campeche). If you prefer to be close to nightlife, Lagoa is probably your best bet, although there are also peaceful and quiet accommodations available here. Floripa exudes a laid-back, chilled, and relaxed vibe that is sure to captivate any outdoor enthusiast, just as it did for me.

Meeting people and making friends in Floripa shouldn't be a problem either, as Brazilians are some of the friendliest people I have ever encountered. Additionally, it's easy to connect with fellow digital nomads from all over the world. I recommend joining the local digital nomad group to stay informed about the exciting events they organize.

If you're in search of a coworking space in Floripa, I suggest checking out We Cowork It Out in Lagoa. Alternatively, if you prefer working from a café, Cultura Cafe is a good option, although the internet connection there can be unreliable for calls based on my own experience.
