Florianopolis, known as Floripa by the locals, is situated in the southern part of Brazil on the island of Santa Catarina. It has emerged as an excellent destination for digital nomads. For those who need to adhere to a specific time zone due to work, Floripa is only 4 hours behind most European time zones and just 1 hour behind EST, making it a convenient choice for individuals working with teams based in the US and Europe.

For anyone who loves spots that are "easy" for doing outdoor sports, here are 10 reasons why you should book your flight to Florianopolis right now!

1. Running trails

You can jog along the scenic Beira-Mar Avenue, explore the green trails of Parque Estadual do Rio Vermelho, or challenge yourself by running up the famous Morro da Cruz. With stunning views all around, running in Florianopolis is an incredibly energizing experience. For all trail running lovers out there - check out Track Costa da Lagoa - my personal favorite.

2. Kitesuring paradise with two lakes (!!)

Florianopolis is famous as a fantastic place for kitesurfing, and it gives enthusiasts the chance to experience this exciting water sport in two beautiful lakes: Lagoa da Conceicao and Lagoa do Peri. These spots have perfect wind conditions and large areas of calm water, making them ideal for both beginners and experienced kitesurfers.

3. Surfing

The island is home to some of Brazil's top surfing spots, attracting surfers from around the world. Head to renowned beaches like Praia Mole, Joaquina, and Campeche, where consistent waves and excellent breaks create an amazing surfing experience.
