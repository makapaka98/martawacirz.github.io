Florianopolis, by the locals called Floripa, is located in the south of Brazil, on the island of Santa Catarina and as it turns out, is a great digital nomad destination. In case you have to stick to a particular timezone (because of the work), Florianopolis is only 4 hours behind most of the European timezones, and only 1 hour behind EST, which I think makes it a convenient destination both for people working with the US-based and European teams. 

My biggest concern when going to Brazil was, obviously, safety. The fact I’m a solo female traveler certainly doesn’t help here. And that’s something you don’t have to be worried about here. During my whole stay in Floripa, I felt very, very safe and haven’t had any unpleasant situations at all (still, you should always use your common sense, I’m speaking from my own experience and these probably vary from one person to another). Florianopolis to me offers a perfect mix of the beach and city life. If you, like me, love outdoor activities such as running, hiking, playing beach volleyball, or surfing - you’re going to love Floripa, it has it all, and even more. Most of the digital nomads stay in the neighborhoods of Lagoa (no beach access, located between two lakes, perfect for kitesurfers), Campeche (a neighborhood by the beach), or Rio Tavares (right next to Campeche). If you want to be close to the nightlife, you probably should choose Lagoa, although you can find very calm and quiet places to stay here too. Floripa has a very laid-back, chilled, and relaxed vibe and I’m sure that any fan of outdoor activities will fall in love with this place, just like I did. 

	
Making friends in Floripa shouldn’t be a problem too since Brazilians are the most friendly people I’ve ever met, and you can easily meet fellow digital nomads too from all over the world too. Make sure to join the local digital nomad group to stay up to date with the cool events they organize. You can find the link to join the group below:

In case you’re looking for a coworking space in Floripa, check out We Cowork It Out in Lagoa. If you like to work from a cafe, a good option is Cultura Cafe, although it might be not the best for the calls, since the internet connection tends to break (at least according to my experience).
