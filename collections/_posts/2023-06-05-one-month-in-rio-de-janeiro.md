Rio left me speechless for numerous reasons. It is undeniably one of the most stunning and extraordinary cities I have ever visited. The city is intricate, picturesque, complex, and quite possibly the most socioeconomically divided place on the planet, with luxury apartments mere steps away from the favelas (slums). Over 20% of the city's population resides in favelas, and according to data from 2013 (as I couldn't find more recent information), 32% of favela residents belonged to the lower class, while 37% were part of the middle class. The largest favela in Rio, Rocinha, is home to 70,000 people, and there are approximately 600 favelas in Rio de Janeiro.
In Rio, favelas are often situated right next to the most affluent neighborhoods. For instance, from Leblon, you can see Vidigal, a favela with 30,000 inhabitants (known as the residence of many actors from the movie City of God). The contrast is striking and helps to comprehend the city's contradictory nature.

Rio de Janeiro is undeniably a marvelous and vibrant city, where you can indulge in a perfect blend of beach and urban life. However, in my opinion, it falls short of being an "ideal" destination for digital nomads. Firstly, safety is a concern, so it's not advisable to roam the city with valuable items, such as your laptop, in your backpack. Moreover, the selection of coworking spaces and cafes is not extensive. Nevertheless, I still fell in love with this enchanting city.

The best neighborhoods to stay in are situated in Zona Sul, the southern part of the city, and include:

- Ipanema (right next to Leblon, my favorite neighborhood and beach!)
- Leblon (considered the safest and most exclusive, albeit expensive, neighborhood)
- Botafogo (the most affordable among the ones mentioned, although it is quite far from the main beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema)
- Copacabana (the most touristy, but more affordable than Ipanema and Leblon)
I have only lived in Ipanema (and loved it), so I cannot provide firsthand experience of living in other neighborhoods. However, I have met individuals living in both Copacabana and Leblon, and they were all satisfied with their choices.
