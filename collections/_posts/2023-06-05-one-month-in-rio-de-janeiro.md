Rio left me speechless for many reasons. It’s undoubtedly one of the most beautiful and phenomenal cities I’ve ever visited. The city is complicated, scenic, complex, and probably, the most socioeconomically polarized place on the planet, where the luxurious apartments are just steps away from the favelas (slums). More than 20% of the city’s population lives in favelas, and, according to data from 2013 (I couldn’t find anything more recent), 32% of the favela residents belonged to the lower class and 37% to the middle class. The biggest favela in Rio is named Rocinha and is home to 70 000 people. There are approximately 600 favelas in Rio de Janeiro. 
In Rio, favelas are often located right next to the noblest neighborhoods. For example, when standing in Leblon, you have a view of Vidigal - a favela with 30,000 inhabitants (home to many actors from the movie City of God). The contrast is striking and helps to understand how much the city of contradictions Rio is.
